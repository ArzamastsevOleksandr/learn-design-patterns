**Design Principle**: Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.

**Design Principle**: Program to an interface, not an
implementation.

**Design Principle**: Favor composition over inheritance.

The **Strategy Pattern** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently of clients that use it.
========================================================================================================================
The **Observer Pattern** defines a one-to-many dependency
between objects so that when one object changes state,
all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

When two objects are loosely coupled, they can interact,
but they typically have very little knowledge
of each other. Loosely coupled designs allow us to build flexible OO
systems that can handle change because they minimize
the interdependency between objects.

Design Principle: Strive for loosely coupled designs between
objects that interact.
